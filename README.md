My process
The challenge was freaking amazing! I really enjoyed this one, mainly because it involved a lot of code. The code was relatively easy, but things to do were a ton so it took me a decent amount of time. I am really happy with the result!

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Mobile-first workflow
Vanilla JavaScript

Continued development
I do think that vanilla JavaScript is completely enough for a lot of projects and I will keep using it for some more time to really understand it, at the end of the day all the frameworks and libraries still get complied to vanilla JS.
