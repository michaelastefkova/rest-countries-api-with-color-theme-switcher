## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

The challenge was freaking amazing! I really enjoyed this one, mainly because it involved a lot of code. The code was relatively easy, but things to do were a ton so it took me a decent amount of time. I am really happy with the result!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### Continued development

I do think that vanilla JavaScript is completely enough for a lot of projects and I will keep using it for some more time to really understand it, at the end of the day all the frameworks and libraries still get complied to vanilla JS.
